Learning Data Science Using Functional Python
-----
Description
-----
Everyone has an opinion on the best way to learn data science. Some people start with statistics or machine learning theory, some use R, and some use libraries like scikit-learn. I'll use several examples to contrast these with a simpler approach using functional programming techniques in Python. In addition, I'll show how even advanced data scientists can benefit from thinking more functionally.

Everyone has an opinion on the best way to learn data science. Some people start with statistics or machine learning theory, some use R, and some use libraries like scikit-learn. I'll use several examples to contrast these with a simpler approach using functional programming techniques in Python. In addition, I'll show how even advanced data scientists can benefit from thinking more functionally.
