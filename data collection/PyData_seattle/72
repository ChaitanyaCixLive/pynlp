Getting a Handle on Indexing in Pandas, Above and Below the Hood
-----
Description
-----
Pandas DataFrame has a wide variety of ways to access and index data, giving lots of flexibility but also room for confusion. In this talk, we'll build up an intuition for how to index a DataFrame, explaining the pros and cons of different indexing methods (loc, iloc, ix, query, etc), how to query a MultiIndex, as well as discussing the indexing engine pandas uses behind the scenes.
-----
Abstract
-----
(draft of detailed abstract - still in flux).  In this talk I'll cover the different ways you can index in pandas (boolean indexers, iloc, loc, ix) as well as the new query() method and how all of those elements work on MultiIndexes and time series + how to avoid issues with chained assignment and SettingWithCopy warnings.  I'll also talk about how pandas handles indexing under the hood and the implications that has for both memory usage and runtime performance.
