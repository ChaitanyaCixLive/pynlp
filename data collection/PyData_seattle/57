Description
-----
Let us explore some of the anti-patterns that organizations end up with in their voyage to the Big Data Nirvana. "Data swamp", "Technology Stampede" and "Big data to nowhere" are all the waypoints one should avoid. Of course, we will also look at the antidotes and folk wisdom in data science as well as data management and ways to extract oneself out of the sandtraps.
