Estimating Impact on Bicycle Ridership of Bike Share Program in Seattle, WA
-----
Description
-----
Using public data on bicycle ridership collected continuously at fixed locations we estimate the effect on ridership from introducing a bike share program in certain neighborhoods of Seattle, WA. The results are displayed on a hosted site and visualized using D3. The analysis is performed real-time as data updates over an API.

Abstract
-----
By using a Differences-in-Differences econometric technique we recover the causal effect of introducing a bike share program in Seattle, WA on ridership at several locations throughout the city. We control for seasonal effects as well as temperature and rainfall.
We build a website to serve as an interactive walk-through of the statistical analysis. By allowing users to explore both the raw and the transformed time-series we hope to grow intuition regarding the more complicated statistics that underlay the analysis.
The web framework uses off-the-shelf packages to create the website, perform the analysis and display the results. The analysis and display components are separated to allow for continuous integration in each as well as a general framework for asking and answering questions involving time-series data.
