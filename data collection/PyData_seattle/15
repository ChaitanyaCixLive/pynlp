Learn to Build an App to Find Similar Images using Deep Learning
-----
Description
-----
Deep Learning is a powerful machine learning method for image tagging, object recognition, speech recognition, and text analysis. In this hands-on tutorial, we’ll teach you the basic concept of deep learning and walk you through the steps to build an application that finds similar images using a deep learning model.

Abstract
-----
We start out with a description of what deep learning is and give examples of applications where it’s been successful. Then we walk through the setup of the GraphLab Create package. In the second half of the tutorial, we walk through a IPython notebook that constructs an image similarity search application using a deep learning model and a nearest neighbors toolkit. If time allows, we will discuss how to combine image features and text features to improve the quality of search results. Folks should walk away knowing how to start building an image analysis application on their own using deep learning.
