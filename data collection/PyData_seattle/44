Abstract

Python 3.5, the latest installment of the language and library, is just around the corner (though you can try out the beta now). This session will cover some of the new syntax and library additions that should have people excited to start using it.
As a teaser (come to the session for all the details), we'll look at better asynchronous programming, simpler mathematics, easier installation, better package management, formalized type hints, flexible function calls, and more!
